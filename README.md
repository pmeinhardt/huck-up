# Huckleberry - Welcome home

My personal Raspberry Pi (home server) management.

Built using [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

## Components

- **ssh-keys** to copy your public SSH key so you can connect securely without typing your password
- **essentials** installs a few useful server monitoring and common build tools
- **dotfiles** sets up the server dotfiles, including git configuration
- **motd** installs the nice "message of the day" greeting you can see above
- **zsh** sets up Zsh as the default shell (configurable via dotfiles)
- **python** install python with pip and pipenv
- **go** installs go
- **rust** installs rust and cargo
- **ruby** installs rbenv, rbenv-update and ruby-build which you can then use to install a ruby of your choice
- **node** installs node and npm
- **home** creates a default directory structure in your home directory
- **shairport-sync** builds shairport-sync for wireless music streaming from your Apple device to your Pi via AirPlay
- **media-tools** installs useful media players, like mplayer
- **hifiberry** configures your Pi to work with the HiFiBerry DAC+ card

## Preparations

There are a few things which you'll need to prepare. Here we go:

1. **ðŸ’¾ Prepare an SD card** Huck-up automates server management using Ansible. Its playbooks are written with Raspbian/Debian systems in mind. If you don't have a Raspberry Pi operating system on an SD card yet, download [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and [install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) it.

   Note: On Raspbian the SSH server is disabled by default. After installing the image, insert the prepared SD card into your local machine and place an empty `ssh` file onto the boot partition to [enable SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/).

2. **ðŸ”Œ Get your Pi up.** Push the card into your Pi and power it up.

3. **ðŸ”— Connect your Pi.** Your Raspberry Pi needs to be connected to your local network. Just hook it up to your router with an ethernet cable if you have one, or else configure [WiFi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/).

4. **âš™ Install Ansible.** On your local machine, install [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html). Alternatively you can also run the huck-up playbook directly on your Pi.

5. **ðŸ“¦ Clone this repoâ€¦** `git clone https://github.com/pmeinhardt/huck-up.git && cd huck-up`

## Provisioning

**Now it is time you adapt the service and deployment configuration to your needs.**

We recommend you keep these versioned in your own fork of this repository.

- Right away, you'll want to edit `base.yml` to your liking and select the roles you need.

- Create a file named `vars/private.yml` and hack away. Values in `private.yml` take precedence over anything defined in `default.yml`. If you're fine with the defaults, just `touch vars/private.yml` and you're done.

- You should probably keep a backup copy of your `private.yml` in a safe place, e.g. in your 1Password vault or somewhere similar.

- Alternatively: You may want to encrypt your `private.yml` using Ansible Vault if you plan on keeping it in your repository. A brief description is presented in a separate section below.

**Be sure not to commit passwords into public repos!**

If you have made changes to your Pi already - in particular if it is available under a different hostname - update the `raspberries` inventory file or create a private copy that you pass to Ansible via the `-i/--inventory` option.

You can verify your Pi is reachable by running:

```shell
ansible --inventory=raspberries --ask-pass --args="/bin/hostname" raspberries
```

The default password is `raspberry` (make sure you change it).

**To bootstrap your Pi, run:**

```shell
./script/bootstrap # if you have not changed the default username
./script/bootstrap --user=USERNAME # otherwise
```

or, if running [locally](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#local-playbooks) on your Pi:

```shell
# change the "hosts:" entry in base.yml to "hosts: 127.0.0.1", then run:
ansible-playbook base.yml --connection=local
```

This will get everything set up and you're good to go.

You might have to reboot your Pi for some changes to take effect, e.g. the HiFiBerry device tree setup.

**You can rerun these commands from time to time in order to keep your Pi up-to-date.**

A handy script to do that for you is available. Just run `./script/update`.

## Encrypting configuration files

If you keep application secrets in your configuration files, you can use [Ansible Vault](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html) to encrypt them.

When you override the default variables for a deployment for instance, encrypt the variables file as follows:

```
ansible-vault encrypt vars/config.yml
```

This will prompt for a password and save the file as encrypted data. When running a playbook containing Vault-encrypted files append `--ask-vault-pass`, i.e. run:

```
ansible-playbook --inventory=raspberries base.yml --extra-vars=@vars/config.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

## Creating backups

To come.
