# Ansible inventory file
#
# This inventory file is intended for bootstrapping a fresh Raspberry Pi with
# standard configuration (in particular hostname, username and password).  If
# you have made any changes to your Pi already, you may need to edit this file
# accordingly, create a private copy or specify the changed values on the
# commandline.
#
# BE SURE NOT TO COMMIT PASSWORDS TO A PUBLIC REPOSITORY!
#
# If you changed the hostname of your Raspberry Pi, update the host entry in
# the 'raspberries' group below by providing the Pi's DNS name or IP address.
# You can also provision multiple hosts simultaneously:
#
#   [raspberries]
#   192.168.1.10
#   rpi.dns.name
#
# If your host runs on a non-standard SSH port you can put the port number
# after the hostname with a colon. For instance:
#
#   [raspberries]
#   192.168.1.10:2222
#
# If you want Ansible to SSH into your host as a different user,
# e.g. 'mark', you can provide the username as a host variable:
#
#   [raspberries]
#   rpi.dns.name ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=mark
#
# or you can specify the username on the command-line:
#
#   ansible-playbook --inventory=raspberrypi --user=mark site.yml
#
# In order to have Ansible ask for the connection password,
# add the -k/--ask-pass option to the ansible-playbook call.
#
# Once you have deployed your public SSH key to the Pi,
# you can just leave out the password.
